SQL PreparedStatement within IntelliJ IDEA

SQL PreparedStatement is a feature in Java that allows you to execute parameterized SQL queries. It provides a way to write dynamic SQL queries with placeholders for parameters, which can be later bound with specific values.

Here's a brief overview of how PreparedStatement works:

Query Preparation: A PreparedStatement is created by preparing a SQL statement with placeholders for parameters. Placeholders are typically represented by question marks (?).

Parameter Binding: After preparing the statement, you can set the values for the parameters using various setter methods provided by the PreparedStatement class. The values can be supplied dynamically based on user input or program logic.

Query Execution: Once the parameters are bound, you can execute the PreparedStatement to execute the SQL query against the database. The query is sent to the database with the parameters already included, eliminating the need for string concatenation or manual escaping of values.

Benefits of using PreparedStatement:

SQL Injection Prevention: PreparedStatement helps prevent SQL injection attacks by automatically handling escaping and sanitization of user-supplied values.
Performance Optimization: PreparedStatements are compiled and cached by the database, allowing for faster execution of subsequent similar queries.
Code Readability: Parameterized queries improve code readability by separating the SQL logic from the data values.
